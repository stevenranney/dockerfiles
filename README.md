# Various useful Dockerfiles 

## Notes

* Docker file in `/python_env` needs to be edited and trimmed
    * current clone uses a lot of NVIDIA stuff that I don't think I'll need
    * would also need to update the `/home` dirs so it's not referencing the creater, `pisymbol`
## News

* Cloned from https://github.com/pisymbol
